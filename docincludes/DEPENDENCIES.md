The xeokit SDK consists of multiple NPM packages, managed in one repository with
[Lerna](https://lerna.js.org/). All code, excluding Node.js-based tests, is written in TypeScript.

After cloning the repository, run:

```shell
yarn install
```

The project relies on [Yarn workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/docs/workspaces/) and will not build with npm. To
build and test all code, run:

```shell
yarn run dist
```

To run an arbitrary command across all packages:

```shell
lerna exec -- <command>
```

### Pull requests

Before adding new features or packages to the repository, please open an issue on GitHub to discuss
your proposal. Some features may not fit the current scope of the project, or may be more than we are
able to maintain long-term. Even if a feature does not end up in this repository, custom
extensions and functions can be defined and used externally. Changes including test coverage are
strongly preferred.

New features should be compatible with both Node.js and Web, though exceptions may be possible in
certain situations. To accomplish that, any platform-specific resources (like instances of
[HTMLCanvasElement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API) or
[headless-gl](https://github.com/stackgl/headless-gl)) are passed into API functions by the user,
rather than being created by the API directly.

### Dependencies

We recommend compiling with Node.js v12.x, which is the latest version with a prebuilt binary for
`gl` as of April 2020.

Runtime dependencies should be installed only to the sub-package in which they are needed. Any
devDependencies are shared across all packages, and should be installed in the project root. Pull
requests should omit any changes to `dist/*` artifacts.

### Documentation

Documentation and examples are written in JSDoc comments on the relevant classes and methods,
processed with [TypeDoc](https://typedoc.org/), and rendered to the default TypeDoc theme. Additions
and clarification are welcome, and examples may be added inline alongside class documentation.
Certain JSDoc tags have notable meanings within this project:

- `@internal` methods and classes are (1) hidden from documentation, and (2) not included in
  TypeScript definitions for the package. This code is intended only for use within the defining
  package.
- `@hidden` methods and classes are hidden from documentation, but still included in TypeScript
  definitions for the package. This code is not intended for wide use, but may be necessary for
  other packages in the xeokit-sdk monorepo.

### Releasing

> NOTE: Only the maintainer can create new releases.

All packages are published together. To create a standard release:

```shell
lerna publish [ patch | minor | major ] --force-publish "*" --otp <OTP>
```

To create an alpha release:

```shell
lerna publish prerelease --dist-tag next --force-publish "*" --otp <OTP>
```
