    "summary": "Create a Viewer with a WebGLRenderer, a Scene and one View. In the Scene, build a SceneModel containing a table-shaped model. Configure the SceneModel with retained: false, which causes it to not retain SceneObject, SceneMesh and SceneGeometrys in browser memory, which results in a smaller memory footprint. The Viewer then draws the model in the View's canvas, while the model's geometry and materials reside entirely in GPU memory.",
