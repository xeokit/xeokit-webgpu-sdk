    "summary": "Create a Viewer configured with a WebGLRenderer, a Scene, and one View. Create a Data. In the Scene, create a SceneModel. In the Data, create a DataModel. Use SceneModel's fromJSON method to load JSON-encoded model geometry and materials into the SceneModel. Likewise, use DataModel's fromJSON method to load a JSON-encoded entity-relationship model into the DataModel. The Viewer then draws the IFC model in the View's canvas.",
